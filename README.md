# Nemo-IconSidebar
Replaces the sidebar symbolic icons with regular icons

This is (obviously) a clone of https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo My original intention is to figure out how to get the Nemo sidebar to look like the Nautilus one, including theming like in the Layan gtk theme. First step is allowing icons back in the sidebar. The only files fiddled with were nemo-places-sidebar.c nemo-icon-names.h and nemo-file.c.

For some reason, some icon themes (like WhiteSur GTK) don't work, but I think it's to do with the symbolic icons included in the respective theme.FlatWoken does work.

# Next Steps
Figure out styling the sidebar
